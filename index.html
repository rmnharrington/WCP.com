                            decorative markings; she tapped several of them in a specific and intricate pattern. A copy of
                            herself materialized next to her, and on the desk appeared a copy of the bag. She pointed to the
                            table she had been lying on, and the other version of Lieutenant Amanda Jones nodded and
                            moved to take her place.

In the distance the sound of angry humans screaming and yelling grew. She turned in the direction of the sound and saw a feint yellow glow in the mist. Taking another deep breath and letting it out slowly she raised an eyebrow in irritation and began to walk towards the noise and light. The closer she got to the light the more defined the sound grew, it was the sound of a rather angry mob and she wondered what that had to do with the small elaran rogue.

                            Rain felt and heard a slight hum circle around her, causing her bones to vibrate almost painfully. She wasn't sure, but it almost felt like an agreement of some kind. It faded as quickly as it had come and as she looked around. The older dwarf was settling into a rather comfortable looking padded seat on the tram and she realized that he didn't seem to have heard it.

                            Setting the bottle aside, she reached for the sheepskin bundle, carefully unwrapping it.<br>
                            Nestled within the soft folds was a leather-bound book, its cover dyed a deep, burnished orange-brown, the color reminiscent of old autumn leaves or aged wood touched by firelight. At the center of the cover, an indented oval had been carefully stitched into the leather, framing a hand-painted image of a lone tree silhouetted against a rich, fading sunset.<br>
                            Encircling the oval, embossed in gold lettering, were the words:<br>

                            “The mask found its way into a private collection, then briefly into a museum. And then—” The professor’s mouth tightened. “The Great War erupted. In the chaos, the mask vanished. No records of where it went, no certainty of its fate. The tomb Geramaldi sought remains undiscovered, and the mask—if it exists at all—is still missing.”<br>
                            He drew himself upright once more, his voice resonant. “And this, my students, is what I mean by stewardship. History is fragile. A single careless act, a single greedy hand, and an entire chapter is lost. Ask yourself when you uncover your first artifact—what will you do with it? Will you preserve it, protect it, ensure its story endures? Or will you, like so many before, serve ambition and consign history to silence?”                        </p>

                            Every instinct in her begged her to stay right there, in the stillness between breaths, wrapped in warmth and safety and something far more dangerous than either. She wanted to stay and memorize the shape of his arms, the smell of his skin, the weight of his presence.<br>
                            But she knew better.<br>
                            Jack wasn’t here for her. He wasn’t here because he wanted to be. He was here because the university—or fate, or some twisted bureaucratic compromise—had placed him in her path. To him, she was an obligation, not a choice. And she wasn’t about to make the mistake of pretending otherwise.<br>

                    <p class="about-intro">
                        I've been crafting stories since the 1980s, when I was just a kid with a wild imagination and a typewriter. 
                        What started as childhood adventures has evolved into a lifelong passion for creating worlds that readers can lose themselves in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a traditional author, my books grace the shelves of Barnes & Noble and independent bookstores across the country. 
                        There's something magical about walking into a bookstore and seeing your work among the greats—it's a dream I've been living for decades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My writing spans multiple genres because I believe great stories transcend categories. Whether it's a space opera that explores 
                        the human condition, a fantasy epic that questions the nature of power, or a historical novel that brings the past to life, 
                        I'm always chasing that perfect moment when words become magic.
