# Character Images for Genre Cards

This folder should contain character images for each genre card background.

## Required Images:

### Science Fiction
- **File**: `lailani-falconi.jpg`
- **Character**: Lailani Falconi
- **Description**: Your sci-fi character image for the Science Fiction genre card

### Fantasy
- **File**: `fantasy-character.jpg`
- **Description**: A character from your fantasy works for the Fantasy genre card

### Romance
- **File**: `romance-character.jpg`
- **Description**: A character from your romance works for the Romance genre card

### Crime Thrillers
- **File**: `thriller-character.jpg`
- **Description**: A character from your crime thriller works for the Crime Thrillers genre card

## Image Specifications:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended Size**: 800x600 pixels or larger
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:3 or 16:9 works well
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## How It Works:
The images will appear as background images on each genre card with a semi-transparent white overlay to ensure text remains readable. The images will be cropped to fit the card dimensions while maintaining their aspect ratio.

## Adding Your Images:
1. Save your character images in this folder with the exact filenames listed above
2. The website will automatically display them as card backgrounds
3. If you want to change which character appears for each genre, simply replace the image file with the same filename
